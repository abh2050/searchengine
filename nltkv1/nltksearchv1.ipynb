    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Legal Document Search Project. This project aims to provide an efficient and effective way to search through a large corpus of legal documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically BM25 (Best Matching 25) algorithm, to index and rank documents based on a given query. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project also includes a simple user interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input their search queries and view the top matching documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project uses several Python libraries, including NLTK for text processing, Polars for data manipulation, and Rank-BM25 for search model generation and querying. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is organized as a Python Notebook, with each cell representing a step in the data processing and search pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow along with the cells in the notebook to understand the workflow of the project, section headers and other markdown are provided to understand what is going on with the code.\n"

       "In the latter part of October, 1938, the Water Pipe Extension Department of Chicago commenced the installation of a new water main in the west parkway of South Kolin avenue from 26th street to 24th place. Starting at 26th street and proceeding north, an excavation approximately thirty inches wide and. six feet deep, was made in the parkway. At the time of the accident, November 3, 1938, the excavation had “only reached 25th Street.” The accident happened at 25th place, which is half way between 25th street and 26th street. The ditch was open in the parkway, which is located between the west curb of Kolin avenue and the sidewalk, no part of the ditch being in the part of the street reserved for vehicular traffic, except the excavation in 25th place, where the accident happened. Part of the ditch near 26th street, where the pipe had already been put in, had been ‘ ‘ filled back. ’ ’ There was a public school and playground at the northeast corner of Kolin avenue and 25th place. After supper on November 3, 1938, Jerry E. Collins, the plaintiff, then eight years old, and who lived near by, at 2652 Kolin avenue, went to play with a friend, Eichard Schreiner, then ten years old, in the school playground, which had swings, slides, basketball baskets, etc., for the use and amusement of the children, and which was kept open in the evening until nine o’clock. On that evening “there were a lot of boys and girls” playing there. Plaintiff and Eichard left the playground about 8:30 o’clock and crossed Kolin avenue. Plaintiff testified that there was a ditch there and some lanterns; that he did not see any wooden barriers; that on the other side of the sidewalk there were wooden horses, but not around this hole; that “these lanterns and the hole attracted us there and we thought we would play there for a while. I had never played there before; ’ ’ that he and Bichard went into the ditch and put sticks into the dirt around the sides and played a game that they called airplane; that the ditch at that place was “sort of cross-shaped;” it was about four feet deep and about up to his shoulders; that they put sticks in the walls and played that the sticks were airplane controls ; that after they played airplane for a while they got out of the ditch and saw that one of the lanterns was not lit and Bichard got a stick and tried to light it on a flare that was standing in the street; that they were both out of the ditch when this happened. “Q. And what did Bichard do ? A. He got a stick and he was trying to light it and this flare upset and it exploded. . . . Q. What, if anything, did you hear ? A. It was sort of a hollow sound went off. Q. And when that happened, what did you see, what happened to you? A. There was a burst of flame, and I caught on fire and I jumped back and I fell in this hole. Q. And what, if anything, did you feel when this sound was heard? A. Well, there was some liquid was spread on me, then I caught fire.” The witness further testified that before that night he had been by this ditch when he went to the playground but that he had never played in it. “Q. What have you seen around there before? The Witness: I saw some boys were playing around there sometimes and they were lighting paper sticks from the fire on the flares.” Upon cross-examination the witness stated that on that evening before they went into the playground he saw boys playing around this ditch; that there were no lights in the ditch; that the lanterns and torches were on the dirt that had been spilled out from the ditch. Bichard Schreiner testified that he called for Jerry at his home and they went to the playground, where they played on the slides; that there were many boys about his age playing there; that to reach the playground they had to cross Kolin avenue; that when they left the playground about 8:30 o ’clock it was dark; that at Kolin avenue and 25th place they were “putting some kind of water pipes in” on the west side of Kolin avenue; that he and Jerry went to the hole on the northwest corner “out in the street;” that the hole at that place “was like a cross, and we were playing airplane there;” that they “stuck sticks inside the ground and alongside of the hole, and played for controls and thing’s like that;” that while they were playing they saw that a kerosene lantern was unlit and they climbed out of the hole and found some sticks and tried to light that lantern, which was on a wooden horse alongside the sidewalk; that he got a twig and tried to light it on a flare which was standing alongside the curb in the street; that the flare was lighted. “Q. And just tell all of us here what happened. A. Well, I got the stick and I tried to light it on the— on that flare, and it didn’t, of course, so I tried it again, and then that flare accidentally tipped over, and a burst of flame came from the flare, and I jumped over a dirt pile, and Jerry jumped back and fell in the hole and caught on fire. Q. What, if anything, did you hear when this happened? A. Like a bang, a noise.” The witness further testified that he tried to toss dirt on Jerry, who was in the hole, and then a man in a car came up and tossed dirt on Jerry and then the man went to the back of his car, got out a blanket and wrapped it around Jerry; that before that evening “the kids on the block played there,” “the kids were digging holes, you know. There was a long hole, then they started digging another hole, then they used these flares. They got paper and made torches out of it, and they have lights;” that before that evening he had seen a watchman around there but not that night; that from the time they started playing until Jerry was taken away he did not see the watchman; that at other times before the evening of the accident he had seen the watchman “walk along Kolin Avenue, where the ditches were, and chase the kids away.” Upon cross-examination the witness stated that he did not know what caused the flare to tip over; that neither he nor Jerry kicked it over and that the twig did not tip it over; that he and Jerry were kneeling on the ground at the time the flare tipped; that about two days before that evening he had lit paper from the flare but that he did not tip the flare; that the unlit lantern was right near the flare; that before he tried to light the stick he had opened the top of the lantern in order to light it; when the flare tipped over it did not stay tipped but “went back again.” Eichard Jouza testified that he lived on 25th place about three or four houses from Kolin avenue; that he knew plaintiff but did not see the accident. “Q. What had you seen children doing there on the night before this boy was hurt? A. Well, lighting torches, running around, playing and all sorts of things. Q. Lighting torches from where? A. From oil lamps. Q. And torches, what do you mean by that? A. Well, take long sticks and wrap paper or something around them, and stick them in the fires, and run around with them. Q. Fire from where ? A. From the oil lamps. Q. Well, what kind of lamps do you mean? You mean a lantern? Do you mean a lamp or a flare, or what do you mean? A. It is a square sort of — I don’t know what you call them. Q. Those open flares? A. Yes, sir. Q. Had you done that yourself ? A. Yes, sir. Q. And had you seen other children do it? A. Yes, sir.” Upon cross-examination the witness testified that the watchman “was around there sometimes. I hardly had seen him though. . . . He was a stout man. . . . Q. And when he came around, you ran away from those torches, didn’t you? A. Yes, sir.” Anton Motycka testified that he lived at 2213 South 56th avenue, Cicero, and for eighteen years had been engaged in the fruit and vegetable business; that about 8:30 o’clock on the evening in question he was driving east on 25th place in his automobile and as he approached Kolin avenue and 25th place he noticed the excavation and then he saw a burst of flames flare up into the air from the excavation; that he stopped when he reached the spot, jumped out of his car, “looked down into the hole and there was a boy on fire;” that he then dragged, pulled the boy out of the pit; that he was burning from the waist up, and “when I got him out of the hole I stood the boy up and the flames were shooting from his waistline to about three feet over his head. I tried to get the flames out with loose dirt that was there from the pit but it didn’t work, so I thought of my robe in the car and I ran to the car and grabbed that robe and put it over the boy’s head and smothered the flames;” that he, the witness, “called for help, but nobody showed up;” and that he then put the boy in his car and took him home. Upon cross-examination he testified that in putting out the fire several of his fingers were burned very much; that he saw the other boy after he got plaintiff out of the hole; that he did not know the plaintiff nor his family and that he had never seen plaintiff since the evening of the accident.\n",
       "We quote from the brief of defendant: “The burns received by the plaintiff were extremely severe. He was subjected to a long course of medical treatment. A physician who examined him in January, 1941 found extensive scarifications of the tissues covering almost the entire part of the body from the waist up. The scars about the neck were so contracted that they held the head in a downward, tilted position, so that the plaintiff could not bring his head upwards and backwards. There were also contracting bands about . the armpit and breast restricting the outward motion of the. arm. There were sears on the back of the left hand.” The foregoing statement does not fully present the boy’s injuries. However, defendant does not question the amount of the verdict. Richard Schreiner was not burned.\n",
       "Defendant states: “The defendant’s theory is that the evidence does not show that the flare exploded or that the flare was an attractive nuisance or that the defendant was otherwise guilty of negligence.” As to the errors relied upon for reversal defendant states: “1. The verdict of the jury is contrary to law. 2. The trial court erred in not sustaining the defendant’s motions for a directed verdict, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and in arrest of judgment. ’ ’ Defendant contends that plaintiff failed to make out a prima facie case and that the trial court erred in not directing a verdict for defendant, and it asks us to reverse the judgment and enter judgment here for defendant.\n",
       "The following is plaintiff’s theory of the case: “Plaintiff contends, and it is charged in the complaint, that the open ditch with the lighted torch and open flame flares was an attraction to children and an inducement to them to play about the ditch and with the lighted flares, and that the defendant knew or should have known all of said facts, that in addition plaintiff’s theory of the case is that this particular flare was not in proper and safe working order; that the watchman stationed there by defendant failed to perform his admitted duty, and that said bomb flare contained a fuel that was highly volatile and dangerous, so that when it was tipped over by the children in play it exploded.”\n",
       "“ ‘A motion to instruct the jury to find for the defendant is in the nature of a demurrer to the evidence, and the rule is that the evidence so demurred to, in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff, together with all reasonable inferences arising therefrom, must be, taken most strongly in favor of the plaintiff. The evidence is not weighed, and all contradictory evidence or explanatory circumstances must be rejected. The question presented on such motion is whether there is any evidence fairly tending to prove the plaintiff’s declaration. In reviewing the action of the court of which complaint is made we do not weigh the evidence, — we can look only at that which is favorable to appellant. Yess v. Yess, 255 Ill. 414; McCune v. Reynolds, 288 id. 188; Lloyd v. Rush, 273 id. 489.’ (Hunter v. Troup, 315 Ill. 293, 296, 297.)” (Mahan v. Richardson, 284 Ill. App. 493. See, also, Wolever v. Curtiss Candy Co., 293 Ill. App. 586, 597.)\n",
       "The foregoing rules also apply to a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Despite the foregoing firmly established principles of law defendant has seen fit to cite as facts for us to consider in passing upon its contentions evidence introduced by it in rebuttal of plaintiff’s evidence.\n",
       "The major contention of defendant is that the verdict of the jury cannot be sustained on the theory of an attractive nuisance. In the instant case the accident happened in a public street and plaintiff was not a trespasser at the time that he was injured.\n",
       "In Flis v. City of Chicago, 247 Ill. App. 128, we had before us a case where the city placed on a public street a tar kettle for boiling tar for street repairs near the home of a five year old boy, who was killed by the tar from the tilting of the kettle through his play. To quote from our opinion in that case (pp. 131, 132):\n",
       "“. . . The number of so-called attractive nuisance cases has increased greatly in Illinois during the past ten years, but in nearly every case where the question has been passed upon by the upper courts the locus in quo was privately owned property and the child injured or killed a trespasser.&#x27; In the present case the accident happened in a public street and the deceased was not a trespasser at the time he was injured. (Deming v. City of Chicago, 321 Ill. 341; Stedwell v. City of Chicago, 297 Ill. 486.) In the recent case of Holmberg v. City of Chicago, 244 Ill. App. 505, 514, the court said: ‘Many physical conditions on a highway might exist which would be attractive and dangerous to children, and a ground for liability in case of injury, which would be looked upon as entirely innocuous if on private property. ’ In a trespass case involving an alleged attractive nuisance, the plaintiff seeks to excuse the trespass on»the ground that there was an attractive nuisance on the premises of the defendant and it is the policy of the law to require the plaintiff in such a suit to make out a very clear case of attractive nuisance. But a distinction must be drawn between such cases and the instant one where children playing upon the public street, as they lawfully might, would be more apt to be attracted by the tar kettle placed on the street than if it had been located upon the private property.”\n",
       "We further said (p. 133):\n",
       "“Unless the facts in the present case are such that all reasonable minds would draw therefrom no other inference than that the tar kettle and the manner in which it was used did not constitute an attractive nuisance, the question became one of fact for the jury to determine. (City of Pekin v. McMahon, 154 Ill. 141, 147-152; True &amp; True Co. v. Woda, 201 Ill. 315, 318; Stollery v. Cicero &amp; P. St. Ry. Co., 243 Ill. 290, 292; Stedwell v. City of Chicago, supra; Anderson v. Karstens, 218 Ill. App. 285, 292; Holmberg v. City of Chicago, supra.)’’\n",
       "In Holmberg v. City of Chicago, 244 Ill. App. 505 (cert. denied by the Sup. Court), the plaintiff’s intestate, an eleven year old boy, was smothered in a sand pile into which he had dug and which the City had allowed its public contractor to pile some eight feet high in a public street. The Appellate Court held that the question as to whether the sand pile constituted an attractive nuisance was a question of fact for the jury to determine and that the trial court was not justified in setting aside the finding of the jury that it was an attractive nuisance. The court said (pp. 509, 510):\n",
       "“. . . It may he assumed, as a matter of common knowledge, that a pile of sand, especially when located on a public street, would prove attractive to the children of the neighborhood. That it did so prove, in fact, is shown by the testimony of the witness Anderson, the owner of the property in question, who testified that several times he had seen children about the sand pile digging caves, and had chased them away. The question then arises, Did the sand pile, in the form in which it was permitted to remain in and along Pine Grove Avenue for some days, present a dangerous situation? And further, Should the defendants have been forewarned, when reasonably considering the matter, that if the sand pile were permitted to remain as it was, injury was likely to occur to some child who might be there to play?”\n",
       "The court further said (pp. 511, 512):\n",
       "“In nearly every case where the question has arisen, the locus in quo was privately owned property, and the child, in the nature of a trespasser, a condition that would not be, in all probability, as alluring, and therefore not fraught with as much danger, as where the locus in quo was a public street, created for, and to be used freely by all, its very existence inviting and implying user.\n",
       "“The question arises whether Bairstow, or the City or both, did or failed to do something in a reasonably careful way, and as a result of the omission or commission, the boy, without negligence on his part, was killed. In the instant case, at first blush, knowing the instincts and the natural urge of children to play and make certain childish adventures, and particularly their natural liking, one might almost say passion, for a sand pile as a source of pleasure, one is inclined to conclude that just such a calamity as happened might have been expected, or anticipated, or thought of as not unreasonably probable. Certainly it must be considered as proper to charge Bairstow and the City with the knowledge that children would go there and would play about, on, and dig into the sand pile. Being chargeable with that knowledge, would they also be expected to realize that if children did go there and play and dig, that some one might, by so playing and digging, get in deep enough to be injured? What knowledge they had and what, considered as average reasonable persons, they were bound to expect, were matters of fact. Were they such that all reasonable minds would, as to the same circumstances, conclude that there was no fault or lack of care in maintaining the sand pile as it was? We do not think so. We might almost take judicial notice that such a sand pile in a public street is inviting to children. As to its danger, it may well be said that no average, thinking citizen would confidently expect it to do harm, but, on the other hand, he might well reason that it could very easily become, as the result of digging, even in play, a serious danger, and such being the situation, it would seem that, under the law, it was not only proper, hut necessary to submit the matter, as a question of fact, to the jury. It was so submitted, and the jury found that the defendants were guilty of negligence. Are we now entitled to override that verdict? We do not think so.”\n",
       "The court further said (p. 514): “The fact, therefore, that this sand pile in which the boy was suffocated was in a public highway becomes important in determining whether or not the evidence justified submitting the case to the jury, and distinguishes the instant case from all the cases cited where the locus in quo was on private property.”\n",
       "The following are some of the Illinois non-trespass cases wherein judgments for plaintiffs were sustained upon the theory that an attractive nuisance was present: Engel v. City of Chicago, 290 Ill. App. 604; Petrovic v. City of Chicago, 251 Ill. App. 542 (cert. denied by Sup. Court); Fleming v. City of Chicago, 260 Ill. App. 496; Brownell v. Village of Antioch, 215 Ill. App. 404; Stedwell v. City of Chicago, 297 Ill. 486; Shapiro v. City of Chicago, 308 Ill. App. 613; Harrison v. City of Chicago, 308 Ill. App. 263.\n",
       "In Deming v. City of Chicago, 321 Ill. 341, a nine year old boy was electrocuted when he climbed a tree to retrieve a kite which had become lodged in the branches, and came in contact with an uninsulated electric wire that passed through the tree about twenty feet above the ground. There the court said (p. 343):\n",
       "‘1 This injury occurred in a tree in a public street and the deceased was, therefore, not a trespasser at the time he was killed. (Stedwell v. City of Chicago, 297 Ill. 486.) Plaintiff in error was bound,&#x27; in placing in the street wires which carried a heavy load of electricity, to guard against accidents by the exercise of that degree of care commensurate with the danger incident to the use of such a dangerous agency. (Hausler v. Commonwealth Electric Co., 240 Ill. 201.) Whether the tree located in the public street was so attractive to children in their sports as to suggest the probability of such an accident as occurred, and whether the city was negligent in maintaining the wires as it did, were questions for the jury. (Stedwell v. City of Chicago, supra.) There was sufficient evidence of negligence to justify the court in submitting the case to the jury, and the motion to direct a verdict was properly overruled.”\n",
       "Defendant contends that the Supreme Court, in the case of Burns v. City of Chicago, 338 Ill. 89, stated that the principle of attractive nuisance must be very cautiously applied. In that case, the opinion quotes from the opinion in United Zinc Co. v. Britt, 258 U. S. 268, wherein that court said (pp. 274, 275):\n",
       "“ Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. McDonald, 152 U. S. 262, and kindred cases were relied upon as leading to the result, and perhaps there is language in that and in Railroad Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657, that might seem to justify it; hut the doctrine needs very careful statement not to make an unjust and impracticable requirement. . . . Infants have no greater right to go upon other peoples ’ land than adults, and the mere fact that they are infants imposes no duty upon landowners to expect them and to prepare for their safety. On the other hand the duty of one who invites another upon his land not to lead him into a trap is well settled, and while it is very plain that temptation is not invitation, it may be held that knowingly to establish and expose, unfenced, to children of an age when they follow a bait as mechanically as a fish, something that is certain to attract them, has the legal effect of an invitation to them although not to an adult. But the principle if accepted must be very cautiously applied.” (Italics ours.)\n",
       "The opinion in the Burns case, written by Commissioner Edmunds, cites that part of the opinion in United Zinc Co. v. Britt, supra, which we have heretofore quoted, and states (p. 100):\n",
       "“In our opinion the position thus recently taken by the Supreme Court of the United States to the effect that a doctrine which is admittedly an exception to established rules of law ‘must be very cautiously applied,’ is sound as well as significant.”\n",
       "Mr. Justice Holmes, who wrote the opinion in United Zinc. Co. v. Britt, was passing upon a case where a child was a trespasser upon the land of the defendant, and where it was held that no license or invitation could be implied from the facts in evidence. That case did not apply to the facts in the Burns case, where the attractive nuisance was situated in a public street, at the curb. The Burns case was decided upon the finding that the alleged attractive nuisance was not an attractive nuisance.; that the boy at the time of his death was killed by an electric shock received while at the top of a twenty-six foot tubular steel pole owned by the defendant for street lighting purposes; that the pole was not an attractive nuisance and that the boy climbed it by extraordinary effort and for the purpose of winning a wager. .\n",
       "In Wolczek v. Public Service Co., 342 Ill. 482, the court stated (pp. 490, 491): “Cases cited by plaintiff in error are to be distinguished on the facts and are not to be taken as a modification or limitation on this rule. Of such case is Burns v. City of Chicago, 338 Ill. 89, where it was held that the evidence concerning a tubular steel electric light pole did not tend to prove that that pole was attractive to children. In that case it was also held that the pole was not the proximate cause of the injury but that the boy climbing it was induced to do so by reason of wagers made between himself and other boys.” Mr. Justice Stone, who wrote the opinion in the Wolcseh case, refers to United Zinc Co. v. Britt, supra, and calls attention to the fact that three of the justices dissented from the opinion in that case and states that the opinion of the dissenters is in accord with the rule “long established, in this State.” (p. 491) Mindeman v. Sanitary District, 317 Ill. 529, cited by defendant, involves a trespass case. In Simons v. Dole Valve Co., 288 Ill. App. 288, cited by defendant, the plaintiff contended that the defendant maintained an attractive nuisance on its premises which remained unguarded to children as invitees. Dabrowski v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 303 Ill. App. 31, cited by defendant, not only involved a trespass upon the right of way of the railroad company but the evidence showed that children found a partly burned fusee on the right of way and took it home, and that subsequently another child, who was plaintiff’s brother, lighted the fusee, which ignited plaintiff’s dress, and the court held as a matter of law that even if the railroad company was negligent in leaving the fusee burning on its right of way, that negligence was not the proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury. Defendant cites two decisions of sister States but in our opinion it is unnecessary for us to consider them, in view of the fact that many Illinois decisions bear directly upon the question before us.\n",
       "Unless all reasonable minds would agree that the ditch, the adjoining embankment, the lantern, the flare, all situated very near a public playground, frequented by many young children, did not constitute an attractive nuisance, the question became one of fact for the jury to determine. (See Flis v. City of Chicago, supra, p. 133, and the cases there cited.) Prior to the accident children played about the ditch and lighted torches made of paper and sticks from the open flares; “the kids on the block” played there. Children took long sticks, wrapped paper or something around them, and lit them on the flares and they ran around with the lighted sticks. Sometimes the watchman drove the children away. When the children saw the watchman they ran away from the place. Eichard testified that the watchman was not there that night. Defendant maintained a twenty-four hour watchman service upon this work. 1 ‘ The shifts were 8 a. m. to 4:30 p. m., 4:30 p. m. to midnight, and midnight to 8 a. m. the following morning . . . one watchman on each shift.” There were twenty flares and twenty-five red lanterns on this job. Although the work at the time of the accident did not extend the distance of two blocks the watchman who was supposed to be upon duty at the time of the accident testified that he did not know that evening that an accident had happened and that the first that he heard about it was when-he was told about it the next day. Motycka testified that as he approached Kolin avenue and 25th place he saw a burst of flames flare up into the air from the excavation and that when he got the plaintiff out of the hole and stood him up “the flames were shooting from his waistline to about three feet over his head;” that he called for help but nobody showed up. The watchman testified that he was present on that evening and was attending to his duties, but that he did not see anything unusual occur from 4 p. m. until 12 o’clock midnight on November 3, 1938. He stated, at first, that his duty was to watch the properties of the City of Chicago on that project and that his duties did not call upon him to look out for children, but he finally admitted that it was a part of his business to chase children away and keep them away from the flares and ditches, but that he had never had occasion to chase or keep them away. We, are satisfied that if this watchman had been performing his duties upon that evening the accident to plaintiff, with all of its terrible consequences, would not have occurred. Because of the close proximity of the public playground the watchman should have been extremely vigilant in the performance of his duty to keep the children away from the flares and ditches. The only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence is that the watchman was absent from the job at the time in question. We hold that under plaintiff’s evidence the question as to whether the locus in quo constituted an attractive nuisance became one of fact for the jury to determine, and the jury has determined the question adversely to defendant’s contention. We feel impelled to say that we are satisfied with their finding.\n",
       "But plaintiff’s case does not entirely depend upon a finding that the locus in quo constituted an attractive nuisance, as defendant assumes. The complaint charges that defendant was negligent in failing to maintain a watchman at the place to prevent children from playing about in close proximity to the flares. It further charges that the flare used was not so ballasted, shaped, weighted, or placed as to be substantial and not easily upset or turned over. It further charges that the fuel in the torch was volatile and of a dangerous character, and the flare was not in proper and safe working order. The complaint also charges general negligence. In our judgment even if it could be held that the situation presented did not constitute an attractive nuisance, nevertheless, under the pleadings and the evidence in the case plaintiff made out a clear case of negligence against defendant. As we stated in Flis v. City of Chicago, supra, (pp. 134, 135): “The attractive nuisance charge, if proved, would be but a circumstance bearing upon the question of the alleged negligence of the defendant.” There was sufficient evidence of negligence to justify the court in submitting the case to the jury, and the motion to direct a verdict was properly overruled.\n",
       "Defendant seems to assume that plaintiff’s case falls if the allegation in count 2 that “the flare violently exploded” is not established by the evidence, and it contends that the testimony of the two children is not sufficient to prove the said allegation. In meeting the testimony of the two boys that the flare exploded defendant relies upon testimony adduced by it which it claims proves that the flare could not have exploded. It is hardly necessary to state that defendant’s evidence could not be used upon a motion to direct nor upon a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. That the testimony of the two boys makes out a prima facie case that the flare exploded seems obvious, but defendant contends that plaintiff should not have been allowed to use the term “exploded” in his direct examination. It would be sufficient to say in answer to this contention that upon cross-examination plaintiff testified that Bichard “was trying to light this stick on this flare, and the flare upset and exploded.” Defendant made no objection-to the use of the term in that answer and made no motion to strike the answer. However, the term is a well understood one. Webster defines it as, “to cause to explode or burst noisily.”\n",
       "No good reason has been urged why the judgment in this case should be reversed and it is therefore affirmed.\n",
       "Judgment affirmed.\n",

       "A chancery proceeding in which plaintiff claims to have received as a gift from James B. McMurdie, deceased, during his lifetime, the contents of a safety deposit box. The complaint charges that Isabelle Crook, as administratrix of the estate of McMurdie, deceased, obtained possession of the contents of the box, has withheld the contents from plaintiff, and has stated that she proposes to distribute the contents to herself, Henrietta Springer, Joseph McMurdie and Grace Campbell, as the heirs of McMurdie; that the administratrix has sold the jewelry contained in the box and has perhaps sold part of the securities contained therein, and has made some disposition of the cash found therein; that the administratrix holds the assets as a constructive trustee for plaintiff and should be required to account to plaintiff and turn over to her the contents of the box together with the proceeds which may have been realized by the administratrix through selling or disposing of part of the contents; that plaintiff is entitled to an accounting against the administratrix and the four individual defendants relative to the contents of the safety deposit box. The cause was heard by a chancellor upon the verified complaint, the verified answer, the verified reply thereto, and evidence heard in open court, and a decree was entered finding the equities in favor of plaintiff and ordering defendant Isabelle Crook, as administratrix, to pay over to plaintiff in due course of administration the sum claimed by plaintiff, $4,233.31, and ordering defendant Isabelle Crook in her individual capacity and the other three defendants to each pay over to the administratrix the sum of $1,293.79. It was conceded that the administratrix sold the contents of the box, save an insurance policy contained therein, for $4,233.31 and that she distributed, without a court order, to each of the individual defendants, including herself, the sum of $1,293.79. Defendants appeal.\n",
       "No point is raised on the pleadings. Briefs were filed by the four defendants sued individually, and briefs were also filed by Isabelle Crook as administratrix.\n",
       "It is clear that plaintiff deserved the gift that she claims McMurdie gave her. After the death of his wife, a sister of plaintiff, and for about four years preceding Ms death, McMurdie resided at the home of plaintiff and her husband. During the last year of his life he suffered from cancer, which caused his death in February, 1940. • Because of his&#x27; condition he required constant nursing and care, which was given to him by plaintiff. She prepared certain diets for him and sometimes it was necessary for her to feed him; she took care of his room and clothing, and plaintiff’s husband bathed him. Plaintiff received no compensation for the nursing and care and McMurdie made no regular payments for board and room during the time that he lived at the home of plaintiff although he occasionally contributed small amounts toward board and lodging.\n",
       "For some time prior to his death McMurdie had a safe deposit box at the Upper Avenue National Bank of Chicago. The box contained stocks, bonds, cash, jewelry, and an insurance policy, and it is stipulated that the value of the contents of the box, exclusive of the insurance policy, was $4,233.31. On the evening of January 5,1940, less than a month before his death, McMurdie was present at a family birthday dinner at the home of plaintiff. Present at the dinner were McMurdie; plaintiff and her husband, E. M. Oliver; Mr. and Mrs. William K. Oliver; William R. Keene, and Mr. and Mrs. Russell M. Oliver. William K. Oliver testified: ‘ ‘ Toward the end of the meal Mr. McMurdie got up and said he wasn’t feeling well, he was going to Ms room. He started away from the table and turned around and said — my mother, Alice Oliver, always called her mother — he said, ‘mother, I am going to give you the key to my safety deposit box. I want you to have the securities there that is in there. I want you to have those.’ At that time he handed her the key to the box and then he went upstairs. ’ ’ William R. Keene, Mr. and Mrs. Russell M. Oliver and Mrs. William K. Oliver also testified to the same effect and there is no substantial variance in the testimony of the five witnesses. None of- the witnesses has any interest in the estate of McMurdie and the testimony as to the gift is not impeached in any way. The able and experienced chancellor who saw the witnesses and heard them testify made a finding in the decree that follows their testimony as to the gift. Counsel for defendants, upon the oral argument, conceded that this court would have to assume as true the testimony given as to the occurrence at the birthday dinner. After January 5, 1940, Mr. McMurdie was in bed most of the time, although he may have been outside of the house once&#x27; or twice. He did not go to the safety deposit box after January 5. Nor did plaintiff, until after the death of McMurdie.\n",
       "This appeal presents a case in which it is clear that McMurdie intended to make a gift of the contents of the box to plaintiff. Defendants insist, however, that the evidence is not sufficient to prove one of the essentials necessary to constitute a gift inter vivos, vis., delivery. On the other hand, counsel for plaintiff contends that the delivery of the key to the safe deposit box was a good symbolic delivery of the contents of the box.\n",
       "“Constructive Delivery. The trend of modern decisions is toward a modification of the early English rule requiring an actual, manual delivery of the property in all cases, to constitute a valid gift inter vivos, and the substitution therefor of a symbolic or constructive delivery, where the circumstances of the case require it. Now, according to the better doctrine, an unequivocal declaration of gift, accompanied by a delivery of the only means by which possession of the thing given can be obtained, is sufficient.” (20 Cyc. 1199.)\n",
       "“Constructive or Symbolical Delivery. The trend of modern decisions is toward a modification of the early English rule requiring an actual, manual delivery of the property in all cases, to constitute a valid gift inter vivos, and the substitution therefor of a symbolic or constructive delivery, where the circumstances of the case require it. Thus, in some cases, an unequivocal declaration of gift, accompanied by a delivery of the only means by which possession of the article given can be obtained, is sufficient. This is the rule where the article intended to be given is not present, or, if present, is incapable of manual delivery, as where it is too bulky. So, if the subject of the gift is under lock and key, delivery of the key, accompanied by words expressing a present intention to give, will satisfy the requirements of the law.” (28 C. J. 636, 637.)\n",
       "“Delivery of Key to Box or Receptacle. — Many cases on constructive delivery have been those in which there was a delivery of the key of a box or other receptacle containing property. The rule that appears to be most in accord with the authorities is that where the things intended to be given are not present, or where present are incapable of manual delivery from their size and weight, a delivery of a key to the receptacle or room containing them is a sufficient delivery to sustain a gift, but that where the articles are present and capable of manual delivery, the delivery of a key is insufficient, especially if the donee does not take the property into his actual possession during the lifetime of the donor.” (24 Am. Jur. 745.) (See, also, 14 A. &amp; E. Encycl. of L. (2d Ed.) 1021, 1022.)\n",
       "The foregoing authorities cite decisions of sister States that follow the symbolic delivery rule. What is the rule in this State?\n",
       "In Telford v. Patton, 144 Ill. 611, 620, the court states what is essential to prove a gift inter vivos and in referring to delivery, one of the essentials, the court states: “The delivery may be constructive, as of a key, or of a part for the whole. (1 Pars, on Cont., supra [marg. page 234]).”\n",
       "In Hagemann v. Hagemann, 204 Ill. 378, there was involved the question as to whether an inter vivos gift of notes was established by proof that the donor placed the notes in an envelope marked with the donee’s name, as owner, executed a writing importing a present transfer and delivery of the notes, and delivered the key to the safety deposit box where the notes were to be kept, to the donee, who subsequently took them into his possession. The court, in referring to the question of delivery, states (p. 383): “Michael [the claimant] was given a key to the box containing the said notes. This alone has been held to be a good symbolical delivery. (Stephenson v. King, 81 Ky. 425; Telford v. Patton, 144 Ill. 611.) ” The court also states (p. 382): “We think it clear that the intention of the donor, in cases of this character, is a controlling factor . . .” (Italics ours.)\n",

       "“The evidence clearly shows that Benson intended to give the notes to his wife and that he believed that he had done so. On different occasions shortly before his death, he stated to his son, to a nephew and to the maker of the notes, that he intended them in lieu of life insurance for his wife and had given them to her for that purpose. The notes were, at the time, locked up in a safe in a shop where he had done business before stricken with his last illness. This case hinges entirely upon the question of whether there was sufficient delivery to make the gift effectual.\n",
       "“Appellee did not have manual possession of the notes until after the death of her husband. He gave to her the key to the safe in which the notes were kept and stated that he gave her the contents of the safe. After his death, she took manual possession of the contents. The notes were the only contents of value in the safe. While delivery of possession of the article is essential to the validity of the gift, the delivery need not always be a manual delivery. The delivery may be symbolic, as the delivery of a key to a chest or a trunk. The term is not to be taken in such a narrow sense as to require that the thing given shall go, literally, into the hands of the donee and be carried away. An unequivocal declaration of gift accompanied by a delivery of the only means by which possession of the article given can be obtained, is sufficient. Grover v. Grover, 24 Pick. 261; Coleman v. Parker, 114 Mass. 30; Hagemann v. Hagemann, 90 Ill. App. 251.\n",
       "“Where the donor, at the time of declaring a gift, divests himself of the means of possession and dominion and invests the donee with such means, he should certainly be considered as surrendering possession. And so when Benson delivered the key to the safe to his wife and declared that the contents contained therein belonged to her, he parted with possession of the contents and ceased to have dominion over them. From then on, appellee only, had power of manual possession. We think there was sufficient delivery to make the gift effectual.’’ (Italics ours.)\n",
       "In Cottrell v. Gerson, 371 Ill. 174, 179, 180, the court followed the ruling in Hagemann v. Hagemann, supra, that the delivery of a key .constitutes a symbolic delivery.\n",
       "Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Kirchner, 213 Ill. App. 289, 294, cites with approval the ruling in the Hagemann case.\n",
       "Defendants have not cited any Illinois case that holds that the doctrine of symbolic delivery does not prevail in this State.\n",
       "In Millard v. Millard, 221 Ill. 86, cited by defendants, the opinion shows that the claim of the defendants to the property in question by gift inter vivos was a dishonest one and that the defendants did not hesitate to commit criminal acts in furtherance of their scheme to obtain certain securities belonging to the deceased. As to evidence offered by the defendants as to alleged conversations with the deceased the opinion states (p. 96): “There was evidence that at the time of these conversations the deceased was much of the time unable and unfit to transact any business, and at the time of the last conversation the attending physician did not consider him possessed of sufficient intelligence to transact business. There was other evidence that no such conversation occurred, and the witness admitted that the deceased could scarcely speak and it was very difficult to understand him.” The defendants in that case acted like common thieves and it is not surprising that the Supreme Court concludes its opinion with the following language (p. 97): “We do not think the defendants&#x27;should be permitted to retain property acquired by a raid, in which they participated, on the safety deposit box, without the knowledge of its owner, and they should be required to surrender the proceeds.” The decision in that case did not turn upon the question of symbolic delivery.\n",
       "In Hopkins v. Hughes, 340 Ill. 604, cited by defendants, the court held that a delivery, in the donor’s lifetime, of certain notes to a lawyer to hold for a certain intended donee, with directions to the lawyer to deliver the notes to the donee after the donor’s death upon the presentation by the donee of receipts showing payment by him of certain debts and expenses, including funeral and burial expenses of the donor, does not constitute a valid gift, as such gift is not unconditional and there is no possibility of the vesting of title in the lifetime of the donor.\n",
       "In In re Estate of Wright, 304 Ill. App. 87, cited by defendants, the claimant, Marie Furr, claimed that she was the owner of certain securities by gift inter vivos. She claimed that Wright, the deceased, delivered the securities to one Thornton with the unequivocal intention to pass the title to the securities to her. The Appellate Court of the Second District held (pp. 94, 95): “The gift could have been made to Thornton for Marie Furr, if made absolute and unconditional, so that the gift would have taken effect at once. (Taylor v. Harmison, supra [179 Ill. 137].)”, but the court further held (p. 95):\n",
       "“There is no evidence in the record proving clearly and convincingly that Wright delivered the securities to Thornton and thereby made Thornton the agent of Marie Furr, with Wright parting with all control over the securities absolutely, and making Marie Furr the principal invested with title to the securities and absolute control thereof as owner.”\n",
       "Suchy v. Hajicek, 364 Ill. 502, cited by defendants, states the general rule as to the essentials necessary to make out a gift inter vivos and held that the essential elements were wanting in that case. No question of symbolic delivery was involved. We hold that the rule of constructive or symbolic delivery prevails in this State.\n",
       "A study of many cases that bear upon the question as to whether a gift inter vivos has been proven convinces us that where a claim appears to be a suspicious one the law scrutinizes it with great care and adheres strictly to the rule that the proof as to all essentials necessary to constitute the gift must be clear and convincing, but, on the other hand, where, as in the instant case, the claim is clearly an honest one and the proof leaves no doubt that the deceased intended to give the personal property to the claimant and gave her the key to the safety deposit box in which the property was kept, the law will not be strained to defeat the intent of the deceased. As our Supreme Court stated in the Hagemann case, supra, “the intention of the donor, in cases of this character, is a controlling factor.” The contention of defendants that one of the essentials to constitute a gift -inter vivos, delivery, was not proven by the degree of evidence required by law, is, in our judgment, without merit. Defendants argue that Mc-Murdie was physically able to be up and around after the date of the alleged gift, that the distance from the Oliver home to the bank where the, vault box was located was only about three miles and that it was possible for the deceased, after the alleged gift had been made, to go to the vault and have the records changed so as to deprive plaintiff of access to the box. That McMurdie did none of the things that counsel suggests that he might have&#x27; done tends to support plaintiff’s theory that when he handed her the key he intended to deliver to her the contents of the box.\n",
       "Defendants contend that plaintiff was guilty of laches in not bringing her action until March 13, 1941. It was the theory of fact of plaintiff that after the death of McMurdie she had the keys to the safety deposit box and that she went to the bank and talked to the man in charge of the vault; that she told him that Mr. McMurdie had given her the contents of the box and that as a delivery of the contents he had given her the key and that she wanted the contents of the box, that the vault man informed her that the attempted gift was ineffective and the assets would belong to the legal heirs of Mr. McMurdie, and that it was not until March, 1941, that she consulted Attorney Abraham, and he informed her that she had a legal right to the contents of the box. The parties agreed that William J. Hopkins, the manager of the vault department of the Upper Avenue Safe Deposit Company, testified before Judge Lewe that he had known the deceased for many years; that he did not think that he knew plaintiff, although her face seemed familiar to him, and that she may have been into the bank to see him; that he sees and interviews a great many people daily; that it was possible that the plaintiff had come to the bank and that he had forgotten her visit; that it was possible that she had brought him the box keys and requested entrance.into the vault box, and if she had, he would have advised her, as a matter of practice, that such entry could not be permitted by the bank and that only the personal representative of the deceased could gain admittance to the box; that it might be that she had had such a conversation with him. Plaintiff was a housewife, and it is a reasonable presumption from the evidence that she was unlearned in the law and inexperienced in business. She testified that she did not know of her legal rights until about a week before she instituted her suit, and the evidence as to the transaction in the vault was offered for the.purpose of showing why she did not take action to obtain the contents of the box before the instant suit was commenced.\n",
       "Defendants contend that they were prejudiced because distribution of the estate had been made before the action was brought or any claim made, and in support of the contention cite the following from People v. Thomas, 361 Ill. 448, 457:\n",
       "“Nor can the doctrine of laches avail the relator. Laches consists of such neglect or omission to assert a right as, taken in conjunction with lapse of time more or less great, and other circumstances causing prejudice to the adverse party, operates as a bar. Carroll v. Houston, 341 Ill. 531; Forest Preserve District v. Emerson, 341 id. 442; Morse v. Seibold, 147 id. 318.” (Italics ours.)\n",
       "Mere delay which does not prejudice or injure the defendant is no defense in a proceeding in equity. (Young v. Kich, 369 Ill. 29, 33.)\n",
       "“. . . Laches is such neglect or omission to assert a right as, taken in conjunction with lapse of time more or less great, and- other circumstances causing prejudice to the adverse party, constitutes a bar in a court of equity. (Forest Preserve District v. Emerson, 341 Ill. 442; Thomas v. Chapin, 274 id. 95.) Mere delay in asserting a right does not bar the enforcement of an equitable right unless the statutory period allowed for its assertion has elapsed. (Yunkes v. Webb, supra [339 Ill. 22].) To avail themselves of the defense of laches within the statutory limitation period it was incumbent upon the defendants to show that the complainant’s delay in instituting this proceeding was accompanied by some other element rendering it inequitable for her to assert her title. (Manson v. Berkman, 356 Ill. 20; Yunkes v. Webb, supra; Thomas v. Chapin, supra.) The evidence fails to show that the defendants were in any way prejudiced by the fact that the complainant did not elect to bring her suit to enjoin the obstruction of the easement at an earlier date.” (Brunotte v. DeWitt, 360 Ill. 518, 534.)\n",
       "“. . . The question, then, is whether the mere lapse of time, short of the Statute of Limitations, without action taken by the complainants to enforce their right, amounts to laches so as to bar their remedy. This question must be answered in the negative. Lapse of time is only one of many circumstances from which1 the conclusion of laches must be drawn. Each case must be determined by its own particular facts. (Reynolds v. Sumner, 126 Ill. 58.) Lapse of time, alone, is not sufficient to bar a bill showing equity on its face, (Smith v. Ramsey, 1 Gilm. 373,) and it is no bar where the party has been ignorant of his rights. (Roby v. Colehour, 135 Ill. 300.) Where the obligation is clear and its essential character has not been changed by lapse of time, equity will enforce a claim of long standing as readily as one of recent origin as between the immediate parties to the transaction. (Thorndike v. Thorndike, 142 Ill. 450.) Where there is nothing to show that the defendant has been misled by the delay to his injury, or in any way placed in a worse position by a failure to file the bill at an earlier date, there is no laches. (Turpin v. Dennis, 139 Ill. 274.) The length of time during which the party neglects the assertion of his rights, which must pass in order to show laches, varies with the peculiar circumstances of each case, and is not, like the matter of limitations, subject to an arbitrary rule. It is an equitable defense controlled by established considerations, and the lapse of time must be so great and the relations of the defendant to the rights such that it would be inequitable to permit the plaintiff to now assert them. (Halstead v. Grinnan., 152 U. S. 412.) We have held that mere delay for any period short of the Statute of Limitations could not bar the assertion of title to real estate; that it is only when the delay is accompanied by some other element rendering it inequitable to&#x27;permit the owner to assert his title that laches will bar the right within the statutory limitation period. Gibbons v. Hoag, 95 Ill. 45; Compton v. Johnson, 240 id. 621; Hutson v. Wood, 263 id. 376; Lynn v. Worthington, 266 id. 414; Stowell v. Lynch, 269 id. 437; DeProft v. Heydecker, 297 id. 541.” (Schultz v. O’ Hearn, 319 Ill. 244, 248, 249. Italics ours.)\n",
       "“ ‘The defense of laches, by reason of lapse of timé and inaction of the party seeking relief, will not be permitted where the party was in ignorance of the material facts connected with the transaction which is attacked, or of his rights in relation thereto. . . ” (Sutherland v. Reeve, 151 Ill. 384, 396.)\n",
       "As to the individual defendants the defense of laches is without the slightest merit. They were not prejudiced nor injured by the alleged delay. The administratrix, without leave of court, distributed to Henrietta Springer, Joseph McMurdie, Grace Campbell, and herself the proceeds dérived by her from the sale of plaintiff’s property and the decree merely compels them to turn back to plaintiff moneys that belong to her. The individual defendants have had the use of plaintiff’s money for over two and one-half years. It would t&gt;e a strange rule of equity that would permit the individual defendants to retain the moneys belonging to plaintiff upon the ground of laches.\n",
       "As to the ground of laches, urged by the administratrix : The administratrix contends that as plaintiff did not institute her suit until after she, as administratrix, had made distribution of the proceeds realized from the sale of the stocks, etc., it would be inequitable to permit the present decree against the administratrix to stand. It must be noted that the individual judgment entered against Mrs. Crook is only for the amount that she distributed to herself, in her individual capacity. There is no evidence to show what assets, if any, were inventoried by the administratrix. Indeed, there is-nothing to show when, if at all, an inventory was filed. It was admitted that no final account had been filed and no order of distribution had been entered at the time of the-institution of this suit. Before an administrator can distribute the estate of a decedent he must first obtain an order of the court. (See the Administration Act, ch. 3, par. 445, sec. 291, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1943 [Jones Ill. Stats. Ann. 110.542].) As there was no order for distribution the act of the administratrix in making distribution when she did was a voluntary one and contrary to the statute. Under par. 446, sec. 292, of the Act [Jones Ill. Stats. Ann. 110.543], where an administrator upon a court order pays the distributive share to a distributee before the expiration of nine months after the issuance of letters the distributee must give bond to be approved by the court, conditioned to refund the due proportion of any claim entitled to be paid from the estate distributed together with the expenses of recovery including reasonable attorneys’ fees and additional expenses of administration. The record is silent as to whether bonds were given by the individual defendants before distribution was made.&#x27; Nor does it show when the administratrix obtained her letters of administration nor when she obtained possession of the contents of the box. The judgment against Mrs. Crook as administratrix is payable only out of the assets of the estate in due course of administration. Plaintiff concedes that the administratrix is not personally liable for the amount she distributed and that the administratrix and her sureties are not liable per se for the payment of judgments against the administratrix; that they are liable only for a proper administration of the estate.\n",
       "The administratrix contends that “even if recovery could be had from the administratrix, the decree was erroneous in that it did not limit payment out of assets not previously inventoried in the estate,” and argues that “because no claim was filed or judgment or decree entered against her within the probate year, the decree should limit the recovery against her in her official capacity to assets of the Estate of James R. McMurdie hereinafter inventoried or subsequently discovered.” In support of this argument the administratrix cites People v. Small, 319 Ill. 437. The instant contention is an afterthought. In People v. Small the administratrix pleaded section 70 of the Administration Act, then in force, against the plaintiff’s claim. Here the administratrix filed no plea that raises the question involved in the instant contention and the statement of plaintiff that the instant contention was not made at any point in the proceedings prior to the filing of the brief of the administratrix in this court seems to be sustained by the record. The administratrix, in support of her contention, relies upon section 204 of the Probate Act (ch. 3, par. 356, sec. 204, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1943 [Jones Ill. Stats. Ann. 110.453]), which provides, in part: “All claims against the estate of a decedent, except expenses of administration and widow’s . . . award, not filed within nine months from the issuance of letters testamentary or of administration, are barred as to the estate which has been inventoried within nine months from the issuance of letters . . . . ” Plaintiff insists that the administratrix in the trial court made no defense based upon section 204 and that this court will not consider a defense raised here for the first time. But plaintiff raises a still stronger point against the instant contention, vis., that although the limitations under section 204 require that a claim against the estate must be “filed within nine months from the issuance of letters testamentary or of administration,” the record in the instant case does not show when letters of administration were issued to Isabelle Crook and therefore it does not affirmatively appear that the present suit was not instituted within the nine months’ period. We may add that plaintiff’s claim is not of the character of claims that fall within the purview of section 204. Plaintiff’s claim does not arise out of an act of the decedent which gave rise to a cause of action during his lifetime, but it arises out of the act of the administratrix in taking the property of plaintiff. As counsel for plaintiff argues, if the contention of the administratrix were sustained it would mean that if the administratrix took plaintiff’s property, thereby enriching the estate, one or two days before the nine months’ period expired, plaintiff would thereby be barred from recovering a judgment against the administratrix.\n",
       "The administratrix finally contends that “since Isabelle Crook as administratrix received no financial gain from her alleged wrongful conversion, the equity side of the Court had no jurisdiction to enter a decree against her in her official capacity.” In support of this contention the administratrix states: “As far as the action against Isabelle Crook in her official capacity was concerned, it was a straight suit for conversion masquerading in the guise of an action for an accounting”; that “because as administratrix she received no enrichment, the tort could not be waived by the plaintiff So as to establish jurisdiction in the equity side of the court.” It is sufficient to say in answer to this strained contention that the instant complaint is not predicated upon the theory of wrongful conversion by the administratrix. The complaint charges, inter alia, that after the death of McMurdie, Isabelle Crook, as administratrix of his estate, obtained possession of the contents of the box and has withheld the same from plaintiff, and that she has stated that she proposes to distribute the contents to herself, Henrietta Springer, Joseph McMurdie, and Grace Campbell; that Isabelle Crook holds said assets as a constructive trustee for plaintiff, and that she should be required to account to plaintiff and to turn over to her the proceeds in question. The point now made by the administratrix was not raised nor suggested in her answer to the complaint. The administratrix calls attention to the fact that the word “converted” is used in the decree and that therefore we must hold that the trial court found the administratrix guilty of a tort. The decree finds that Isabelle Crook, acting as administratrix, “obtained possession of the contents of the said box; converted the same into cash and realized from the disposition of the assets . . . the sum of $4,233.31.” In the instant case plaintiff does not seek to recover damages for a tort. The complaint is predicated upon the theory that assets which were the property of plaintiff had come into the estate of the decedent and the complaint seeks an accounting. Howard v. Swift, 356 Ill. 80, cited by the administratrix, has no bearing upon the instant question.\n",
       "After a patient, careful consideration of the contentions raised by defendants in the light of the salient facts we have reached the conclusion that it would be highly inequitable to sustain this appeal. To do so would not only work an injustice to plaintiff but would defeat the plain intent of the decedent to make the gift to plaintiff.\n",
       "At the outset of this appeal plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. We denied that motion, but plaintiff has renewed the motion in her brief and again strenuously argues that the record upon this appeal was filed late and therefore the appeal should be dismissed. While the motion is not without some merit, we have concluded to again deny it.\n",

      "delivered the opinion of the court:\n",
      "Plaintiffs appeal the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant, David N. Johnson (Johnson), finding that his statement of economic interests, as amended, met all statutory requirements. The appeal raises as issues whether (1) the original omissions on Johnson’s statement of economic interests must result in ineligibility for, or forfeiture of, the mayoralty of the City of Harvey, (2) Johnson’s amended statement of economic interests relates back to the date on which he filed his original statement, and (3) evidence was improperly submitted and considered at the March 15, 1991, hearing. In the interests of timeliness, we have already ruled upon the issues presented in this appeal. As indicated in our order of reversal issued on April 19, 1991, our reasons were to be set forth in an opinion, which now follows.\n",
      "The City of Harvey mayoral election was to take place on April 2, 1991. Johnson, the incumbent mayor, sought inclusion on the 1991 mayoral ballot. Damon Rockett, a plaintiff in this case, was one of the other five candidates for mayor of Harvey. Alvin Welch, also a plaintiff, is a resident and legal voter in that city.\n",
      "On January 22, 1991, Johnson timely filed his statement of economic interests in the office of the Cook County clerk, as required by the Elinois Election Code. (See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 46, par. 10—6 (Election Code).) Item number seven on the statement required a candidate to list the name of any unit of government by which he was employed during the preceding year, other than the unit of government related to his candidacy. Johnson wrote “none” in response to that item. Johnson also wrote “none” in response to question number eight, which sought disclosure of any honoraria in excess of $500 received during the preceding year.\n",
      "On February 1, 1991, plaintiffs filed a verified complaint for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, requesting that Johnson’s nominating papers be declared void and that his name not appear on the 1991 mayoral ballot. Plaintiffs claimed that Johnson failed to indicate on his statement of economic interests that he was employed by Community College District 510 (District 510), an independent unit of government. His statement, therefore, was allegedly false and incomplete. Johnson thereafter filed an amended statement of economic interests with the Cook County clerk on February 5, 1991, which listed his employment with District 510 and also disclosed that he had received an honorarium during the previous year in excess of $500.\n",
      "Plaintiffs filed a petition for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin placement of Johnson’s name on the mayoral ballot. Johnson in turn filed his objections to plaintiffs’ petition, in which he averred that he inadvertently entered “none” in response to question seven on the statement of economic interests. He indicated that the correct response should have been “Board of Trustees of Community College District No. 510,” which body had employed Johnson as a tenured professor at South Suburban College for the past 18 years. Concurrent with his objections, Johnson filed a motion to strike and dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint.\n",
      "At the hearing on March 15, 1991, the circuit court denied Johnson’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. Johnson then immediately tendered an answer to the complaint. Plaintiffs moved for judgment on the pleadings, or alternatively, summary judgment. Following further argument, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings. Johnson was then allowed to make an offer of proof as to his state of mind in completing the statement of economic interests. Through the testimony of Johnson and Frank Piekarski, a City of Harvey commissioner, it was adduced that Johnson’s employment with South Suburban College was known throughout the community. He lectured extensively before organizations in Harvey and elsewhere, and his position with the college had been noted in the press. Further, his campaign literature disclosed his employment and activities with District 510. Following the offer of proof, the court took the matter under advisement.\n",
      "On March 19, 1991, the circuit court entered a written judgment summarizing the proceedings to date, ruling on all pending motions, and denying plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The court found that, in light of the offer of proof, Johnson did not intend to falsify his statement of economic interests or mislead voters regarding his employment by District 510. The statement filed on January 22, 1991, together with the amended statement, satisfied the requirements of the Election Code. Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings, which previously had been granted, was denied by the court in a modification of its prior ruling. Summary judgment, instead, was granted in favor of Johnson.\n",
      "Plaintiffs filed their motion for reconsideration on March 21, 1991. At the hearing, they provided affidavits of 93 voters registered in the City of Harvey who had been unaware of Johnson’s employment with South Suburban College. The court denied the motion, and this appeal followed.\n",
      "The mayoral election was held as scheduled on April 2, 1991, with Johnson emerging as the winner by 12 votes. Plaintiffs had appealed on March 21, 1991, and moved for expedited consideration, which was granted.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Plaintiffs first argue that Johnson’s name should have been removed from the mayoral ballot because he provided inaccurate information on his statement of economic interests.\n",
      "The Election Code requires a political candidate’s petition for nomination to include a statement of economic interests, to be filed with the county clerk, as prescribed by the Illinois Governmental Ethics Act (Ethics Act) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 127, par. 601—101 et seq.). Failure to file such statement results in the invalidity of the candidate’s nomination papers. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 46, par. 10—5(3).) The Ethics Act states in relevant part: ■\n",
      "“Any person required to file a statement of economic interests under this Article who willfully files a false or incomplete statement shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.\n",
      "Failure to file a statement within the time prescribed shall result in ineligibility for, or forfeiture of, office or position of employment, as the case may be ***.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 127, par. 604A-107.)\n",
      "The starting point in ascertaining legislative intent is in the language of the statute itself. (Serwinski v. Board of Election Commissioners (1987), 156 Ill. App. 3d 257, 259, 509 N.E.2d 509.) The statute, on its face, makes clear that willful misstatements or omissions violate the Act. Further, a complete failure to file the statement makes the candidate ineligible for office. The statute, however, is silent on the question of whether an inadvertent omission on an economic disclosure statement requires ineligibility for, or forfeiture of, office.\n",
      "In Jones v. Municipal Officers Electoral Board (1983), 112 Ill. App. 3d 926, 446 N.E.2d 256, plaintiff filed a statement of economic interests in connection with his candidacy for alderman of Chicago’s third ward. On the statement, however, plaintiff wrote “3rd Ward” next to his name and did not make any other reference to the office which he was seeking. The court said that candidates were required to comply with section 4A—104 of the Ethics Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 127, par. 604A—104), which, when read together with section 10—5 of the Election Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 46, par. 10—5(3)), made mandatory the inclusion of the office sought. The designation made by plaintiff did not describe the office of alderman for the third ward, and his name was struck from the ballot. Jones, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 929-30.\n",
      "In Havens v. Miller (1981), 102 Ill. App. 3d 558, 429 N.E.2d 1292, candidates for the board of Homewood-Flossmoor School District 233 filed their statements of economic interests with the secretary of the school board rather than with the county clerk. The candidates also failed to include certain information on the circulator’s affidavit contained in their nominating petitions. The court strictly construed the provisions of the Election Code and held that the candidates violated a mandatory statutory provision. Although these deficiencies appeared to be “technical violations,” the reviewing court held that the laws had been designed to protect the integrity of the electoral process rather than a bureaucratic interest. The names of the candidates, therefore, were removed from the ballot. Havens, 102 Ill. App. 3d at 567-69.\n",
      "Other cases have also provided instances where candidates were removed from office or struck from the ballot based on omissions, misstatements, or inaccuracies on their statements of economic interests and on other documents in connection with their candidacy. See Bolger v. Electoral Board (1991), 210 Ill. App. 3d 958; Serwinski, 156 Ill. App. 3d 257; Miceli v. Lavelle (1983), 114 Ill. App. 3d 311, 448 N.E.2d 989.\n",
      "Provisions imposing disqualification of candidates must be construed strictly in favor of eligibility. (Bryant v. Cook County Electoral Board (1990), 195 Ill. App. 3d 556, 558, 553 N.E.2d 25.) The State, however, has been held to have a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral process and in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot. Richards v. Lavelle (1980), 620 F.2d 144, 147; Havens, 102 Ill. App. 3d at 571.\n",
      "In this case, it is undisputed that Johnson’s responses to questions seven and eight on his original statement of economic interests were incorrect. Although it may be inferred from the evidence that he did not willfully make the misstatements, the statute provides only that he is not subject to criminal liability in such a case. Johnson, nevertheless, has failed to comply with requirements prescribed by Illinois statute, and his name should not have appeared on the mayoral ballot.\n",
      "The dissent states that “there is no statutory provision for inadvertent omissions or misstatements.” (Emphasis in original.) (214 Ill. App. 3d at 487.) The Election Code, however, explicitly provides that a candidate’s nomination papers are not valid if he “fails to file a statement of economic interests as required by the Illinois Governmental Ethics Act.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 46, par. 10—5(3).) The Ethics Act, in turn, requires a verified disclosure statement which is “true, correct, and complete.” (Emphasis added.) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 127, par. 604A—104; see Troutman v. Keys (1987), 156 Ill. App. 3d 247, 252, 509 N.E.2d 453; Havens, 102 Ill. App. 3d at 568.) Although section 4A—107 of the statute provides simply that “[fjailure to file a statement within the time prescribed” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 127, par. 604A—107) will result in the appropriate sanction, this language implies that the candidate’s statement be free of omissions and misstatements. If this were not the case, disclosure provisions would serve no purpose and the statement of economic interests would be of no use to the public. Further, Johnson’s preelection publicity, campaign literature, and general reputation throughout the community cannot serve as substitutes for truthful and accurate disclosures on the statutorily required statement of economic interests. (See Hoogasian v. Regional Transportation Authority (1974), 58 Ill. 2d 117, 126, 317 N.E.2d 534.) Johnson’s initial filing, therefore, is akin to a failure to file the requisite statement.\n",
      "Johnson argues that his misstatement should be ignored because the document “was prepared in haste and was not thoroughly read.” Were we to accept his argument, we might encourage others in the future to be less than candid in completing the statement. Johnson signed the verification on the statement, attesting that it had “been examined by [him] and to the best of [his] knowledge and belief is a true, correct and complete statement of [his] economic interests.” (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 127, par. 604A—104.) That statement is not a mere formality and cannot be treated as such. A candidate’s statement of economic interests is important because “[t]he public has a right to know of any financial dealings, however indirect, between a candidate and the unit of government in which he seeks office [and] *** the Election Code [is] designed to facilitate that right.” (Jones, 112 Ill. App. 3d at 930.) The sanction imposed here is in furtherance of the State’s legitimate interest in protecting the integrity of the electoral process by requiring candidates to comply strictly with the election laws. See Havens, 102 Ill. App. 3d at 571.\n",
      "II\n",
      "Johnson’s amended statement, which was filed 14 days after the deadline, did not serve to cure the defect in his original filing. The Election Code does not provide for an amended statement of economic interests, and Johnson has provided no authority to support his argument that the amended filing relates back to the date of the original filing. Johnson, in effect, asks this court to hold that a candidate for public office may amend his statement of economic interests and refile after the applicable deadline. Such a ruling, however, would be tantamount to legislation. Although courts ascertain the meaning of and give effect to every valid act of the legislature, they cannot add language, supply omissions, or remedy defects in matters committed to the legislature, however practical, desirable, or beneficial the outcome. (Spinelli v. Immanuel Lutheran Evangelical Congregation, Inc. (1987), 118 Ill. 2d 389, 402, 515 N.E.2d 1222; Alexander v. Human Rights Comm'n (1988), 166 Ill. App. 3d 515, 518, 519 N.E.2d 1092.) The legislature has provided for amended filing of documents even after lapse of the statutory limitations period in situations where it has seen fit to do so. (See, e.g., Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 110, par. 2—616 (amended pleadings).) Johnson’s amended statement, therefore, did not satisfy the prevailing statutory filing requirements.\n",
      "III\n",
      "Plaintiffs also challenge Johnson’s offer of proof made at the March 15, 1991, hearing. At that hearing, Johnson tendered his answer to plaintiffs’ complaint, and plaintiffs immediately moved for judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment. The court granted plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings. Johnson’s attorney thereafter made an offer of proof as to Johnson’s intentions in filling out the statement. Johnson and a City of Harvey commissioner testified. At the close of the evidence, which established that Johnson’s employment with District 510 was known throughout Harvey, the court indicated that the original order favoring plaintiffs was entered, but that the case was taken under advisement with regard to the offer of proof. In the March 19, 1991, order, the court vacated the prior order and granted summary judgment in favor of Johnson.\n",
      "A motion for judgment on the pleadings tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint. (Freeport Construction Co. v. Star Forge, Inc. (1978), 61 Ill. App. 3d 999, 378 N.E.2d 558.) An offer of proof in connection with such a motion, therefore, is improper. The pleadings raise only a question of law, and the evidence which Johnson submitted in his offer of proof was improper for a disposition on the pleadings alone.\n",
      "Johnson argues that the offer of proof constituted a' motion to vacate judgment pursuant to section 2—1203 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 110, par. 2—1203(a).) No such motion, however, was filed by Johnson.\n",
      "Because Johnson violated a provision of the Election Code, the circuit court erred when it granted summary judgment in his favor. Accordingly, we entered the order in this case which reversed the March 19, 1991, judgment order, voided the Harvey mayoral election, and remanded the matter to the circuit court with instructions to direct the county clerk to order a special election.\n",
      "Reversed.\n",
      "COCCIA, J., concurs. JUSTICE DiVITO,\n",
      "dissenting:\n",
      "I respectfully dissent. There is no question that the filing of a statement of economic interests is a statutory requirement for candidacy for public office in Illinois. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 46, par. 10—5(3).\n",
      "Where the majority and I differ is in interpreting the only statutory provision — a total of two sentences — which provides the only sanctions for doing something or doing nothing in connection with statements of economic interests:\n",
      "“Any person required to file a statement of economic interests under this Article who willfully files a false or incomplete statement shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.\n",
      "Failure to file a statement within the time prescribed shall result in ineligibility for, or forfeiture of, office or position of employment, as the case may be ***.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 127, par. 604A—107.\n",
      "These provisions plainly provide two sanctions relating to statements of economic interests; one is penal, the other is disqualification from office. The willful filing of a false or incomplete statement subjects a person to a Class A misdemeanor charge; failure to file a statement in a timely fashion results in “ineligibility for, or forfeiture of, office.” Period.\n",
      "The majority states that the provision requiring timely filing “implies that the candidate’s statement be free of omissions and misstatements.” (214 Ill. App. 3d at 484.) On the contrary, not only is that implicit requirement absent, there is no statutory provision for inadvertent omissions or misstatements. The only provision which addresses false or incomplete statements explicitly refers to willful conduct — and provides a penal sanction for its violation. In ascertaining legislative intent through the language of the statute itself, which, as the majority points out, is the correct starting point, the appropriate conclusion is that the General Assembly intended exactly what it provided: a criminal sanction for a willfully false or incomplete statement and disqualification for no statement or an untimely one.\n",
      "In my opinion, in its holding that a candidate is ineligible for office for filing a statement containing inadvertent errors, the majority disregards clear and unambiguous statutory provisions which leave no room for interpretation. Though the General Assembly and the citizens of this State have a right to expect candidates to file truthful statements of economic interest, the General Assembly has not provided for office ineligibility or forfeiture for omissions or misstatements. If, as the majority states, the sanction imposed “is in furtherance of the State’s legitimate interest in protecting the integrity of the electoral process by requiring candidates to comply strictly with the election laws,” the General Assembly could have specifically provided for it.\n",
      "The majority correctly points out that provisions imposing disqualification of candidates must be construed strictly in favor of eligibility. I suggest that this court should not create a disqualification where the General Assembly has not done so. I would affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n"
